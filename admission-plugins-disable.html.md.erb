This section describes how to disable one or more admission control plugins for <%= vars.product_full %> clusters. For more information, see [Enabling and Using Admission Control Plugins for 
<%= vars.product_short %> Clusters](./admission-plugins.html).

##<a id='admission-plugin-disable-single'></a> Disabling a Single Admission Control Plugin

To disable a single admission control plugin, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to Ops Manager.
1. Click on the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.
1. Select the Plan, such as **Plan 1**.
1. Deselect (uncheck) the admission control plugin to disable it.
1. Save the changes to the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.
1. Click on the Installation Dashboard, and select **Review Pending Changes**.
1. Verify that the **Upgrade all clusters errand** is selected (enabled) for <%= vars.product_short %>.
1. Click **Apply Changes**.

##<a id='admission-plugin-disable'></a> Disabling an Orphaned Admission Control Plugin

The Ops Manager UI does not let you deselect (disable) all admission control plugins. 
In other words, after an admission control plugin is enabled, 
the Ops Manager UI requires that at least one admission control plugin checkbox is selected (enabled).

To disable an orphaned Admission control Plugin, complete the following workflow:

1. Obtain the FQDN, user name and password of your Ops Manager.
1. Authenticate into the Ops Manager API and retrieve a UAA access token to access Ops Manager. 
    For more information, see [Using the Ops Manager API](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/ops-man-api.html#auth).
1. Obtain the BOSH deployment name for the <%= vars.product_short %> tile by performing the following steps:
    1. In Ops Manager, click on the <%= vars.product_short %> tile. 
    1. Copy the BOSH deployment name including the GUID from the URL:

        <img src="images/pks-guid.png" alt="PKS GUID">
        <br/><br/>
        The deployment name contains "pivotal-container-service" and a unique GUID string. For example, `pivotal-container-service-4b48fc5b704d54c6c7de`.
1. To disable the orphaned admission control plugin, run the following Ops Manager API command:

     ```
     curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/products/pivotal-container-service-GUID/properties" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
     -X PUT -d '{"properties": {".properties.plan1_selector.active.admission_plugins":{"value":[]}}}' \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
	 ```
    Where: 
	   * `OPS-MAN-FQDN` is the URL of your Ops Manager.
	   * `pivotal-container-service-GUID` is the BOSH deployment name of your <%= vars.product_short %> that you retrieved earlier in this procedure.
	   * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is the UAA token you retrieved earlier in this procedure.

	For example:
	<pre class="terminal">
	 $ curl "https<span>:</span>//pcf.example.com/api/v0/deployed/products/pivotal-container-service-4b48fc5b704d54c6c7de/properties" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer aBcdEfg0hIJKlm123.e" \
     -X PUT -d '{"properties": {".properties.plan1_selector.active.admission_plugins":{"value":[]}}}' \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    </pre>
