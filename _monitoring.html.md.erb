#### Wavefront ####
You can monitor Kubernetes clusters and pods metrics externally using the integration with <a href="https://docs.wavefront.com">Wavefront by VMware</a>.<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Before you configure Wavefront integration, you must have an active Wavefront account and access to a Wavefront instance. You provide your Wavefront access token during configuration and enabling errands. For additional information, see the <a href="https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_pks.html">Wavefront documentation</a>.</p>

By default, monitoring is disabled. To enable and configure Wavefront monitoring, do the following:

1. Select **Monitoring**.
1. On the **Monitoring** pane, under **Wavefront Integration**, select **Yes**.
