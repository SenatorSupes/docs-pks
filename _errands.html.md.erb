Errands are scripts that run at designated points during an installation.

To configure when post-deploy and pre-delete errands for <%= vars.product_short %> are run, make a selection in the dropdown next to the errand.

We recommend that you set the **Run smoke tests** errand to **On**. The errand uses the PKS CLI to create a Kubernetes cluster and then delete it. If the creation or deletion fails, the errand fails and the installation of the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile is aborted.

For the other errands, we recommend that you leave the default settings.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Because <%= vars.product_short %> uses floating stemcells, updating the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile with a new stemcell triggers the rolling of every VM in each cluster. Also, updating other product tiles in your deployment with a new stemcell causes the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile to roll VMs. This rolling is enabled by the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>. We recommend that you keep this errand turned on because automatic rolling of VMs ensures that all deployed cluster VMs are patched. However, automatic rolling can cause downtime in your deployment.</p>
