This topic describes how to upgrade Kubernetes clusters provisioned by <%= vars.product_full %>.

##<a id='overview'></a>Overview

When upgrading <%= vars.product_short %>, you can choose one of the following approaches:

* (Default) Upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile and all PKS-provisioned Kubernetes clusters simultaneously.
For more information about PKS upgrades, see [What Happens During Enterprise PKS Upgrades](understanding-upgrades.html).
* Upgrade the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile only and then upgrade your PKS-provisioned Kubernetes clusters following the instructions provided in this topic.

  For more information about this Ops Manager page, see

##<a id='upgrade-clusters'></a>Ugrade Clusters

To upgrade a Kubernetes cluster provisioned by <%= vars.product_short %>, run the following command:

```
pks upgrade-cluster CLUSTER-NAME
```

Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the Kubernetes cluster you want to upgrade.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not make more than four upgrade requests at a time.
When you make multiple upgrade requests using the <code>pks upgrade-cluster</code> command,
<%= vars.product_short %> upgrades these clusters in parallel.
<%= vars.product_short %> can perform only four concurrent upgrades.</p>
