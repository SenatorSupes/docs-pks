VMware's Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) and the Pivotal Telemetry Program (Telemetry) provides VMware and Pivotal with information that enables the companies to improve their products and services, fix problems, and advise you on how best to deploy and use our products. As part of the CEIP and Telemetry, VMware and Pivotal collect technical information about your organization's use of the <%= vars.product_short %> on a regular basis.

Since <%= vars.product_short %> is jointly developed and sold by VMware and Pivotal, we will share this information with one another. Information collected under CEIP or Telemetry does not personally identify any individual.

Regardless of your selection in the **CEIP and Telemetry** pane, a small amount of data is sent from Cloud Foundry Container Runtime (CFCR) to the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. However, that data is not shared externally.

To configure CEIP and Telemetry, do the following:  

1. Click **CEIP and Telemetry**.
1. Review the information about CEIP and the Telemetry program.

1. Choose your participation by selecting one of the following:
  * **None:** If you select this option, data is not collected from your PKS installation.
  * **Standard:** If you select this option, data is collected from your PKS installation and used to improve PKS. This participation level is anonymous and does not permit CEIP and Telemetry to identify your organization.
  * **Enhanced:** If you select this option, data is collected from your PKS installation and used to improve PKS. This participation level permits CEIP and Telemetry to identify your organization and provides proactive support in addition to other features.
1. If you selected the **Enhanced** participation level, enter your VMware account number or Pivotal customer number.
1. Select your PKS installation type.
1. Click **Save**.
