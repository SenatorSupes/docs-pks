This topic provides considerations for using the NSX-T Policy API with <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere.

##<a id='overview'></a>Announcing Support for the Policy API

The NSX-T Policy API is the next generation interface for integrating with the NSX-T networking and security framework. 

Starting with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> v1.12, you can use the NSX-T Policy API instead of the NSX-T Management API to deploy <%= vars.product_short %> on vSphere.

If you are planning on using the NSX-T Policy API, keep in mind that only new deployments of TKGI are supported. You cannot configure an existig installation of TKGI to use the NSX-T Policy API. 

In addition, while all TKGI functionality is supported in both NSX-T modes, Policy and Management, there are some differences to be aware of when configuring NSX-T objects for TKGI, and when configuring the BOSH and TKGI tiles. These differences are described in more detail below.

## <a id='nsxt-policy-versions'></a>NSX-T Versions

To use the NSX-T Policy API with your TKGI installation, you must use a supported NSX-T version. Refer to the [Release Notes](./release-notes.html).

## <a id='nsxt-policy-toplogy'></a>Network Toplogies

To use the NSX-T Policy API, there are no changes required in the preparation of NSX-T: all network topologies are supported.

## <a id='nsxt-policy-intall'></a>NSX-T Installation

To use the NSX-T Policy API, there are no changes required to the installation of the main NSX-T components, including NSX Manager and Edge Nodes. 

For installation instructions, see [Installing and Configuring NSX-T Data Center for TKGI](vsphere-nsxt-index-install.html).

## <a id='nsxt-policy-obects'></a>NSX-T Objects for Kubernetes Clusters

To use the NSX-T Policy API, you must configure the required NSX-T control plane objects using the NSX-T Policy API or UI. Specifically, you must configure the Tier-0 Router (called Gateway in the Policy terminology), the Nodes IP Block, the Pods IP Block, and the Floating IP Pool need to be created using the Policy API or UI.

For specific instructions on creating the required objects, see [Create the NSX-T Objects for Kubernetes Clusters Provisioned by TKGI](nsxt-install-objects-k8s.html).

## <a id='nsxt-policy-config'></a>TKGI Configuration

When you configure the BOSH Director tile for <%= vars.product_short %>, you must enable the option vCenter Config > NSX-T Networking > **Use NSX-T Policy API**. See [Configure NSX-T Networking](./vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html#vcenter-config).

Also, when you configure the TKGI tile in Ops Manager, you must enabled Settings > Networking > NSX-T > **Policy API mode**. See [Configure TKIG Networking](./installing-nsx-t.html#networking).

## <a id='nsxt-policy-mgmt-console'></a>Management Console

If you are using the TKGI Managment Console, you need to select the Policy API in the TKGI configuration section.

## <a id='nsxt-policy-runtime'></a>Runtime

There are no specific runtime considerations for using the Policy API if you have properly configured TKGI to use the Policy API.
